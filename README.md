# Decoder Ring
## This is a program that encodes and decodes secret messages.
### Using the application:
You may view the deployed website at https://jddolvin.github.io/decoder-ring/.
There are four methods of encryption/decryption available for your messages. 
For each method, you must select whether you are encoding or decoding a given message. 

- Caesar Shift
- - Shift number: This number will be needed by the recipient of the encrypted message.
- Polybius Square
- - No additional information is required to use the Polybius Square method.
- Substitution cipher
- - After entering your message, you will have to provide a substitution alphabet. 
- - - This alphabet must be 26 characters long, or it will result in either an error, or the application behaving unexpectedly. 
- - For example: NJKRQDGLYSHTPWOMZAIXUFCVEB

### Using the application locally (on your own machine):
This method is not recommended, as the website is already published as indicated above.
If you really want, you may download the code and use your preferred code editor (VSCode recommended - with Live Server extension), and host this website on your own machine.
